vague goals:
  - more sprites and some mechanism to assign locations
  - add different wall/floor types and map to different textures (started, 2 types of floor)
  - add some kind of translation mechanism to the minimap so the worldmap can be arbitrarily larger
  - expand map editor to configure all those different textures and sprites
  - it's messy - heavy refactoring
  - maybe add strafing motion?
  - some kind of objective
