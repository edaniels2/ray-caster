vague goals:
  - more sprites and some mechanism to assign locations
  - add different wall/floor types and map to different textures (started, 2 types of floor)
  - add some kind of translation mechanism to the minimap so the worldmap can be arbitrarily larger
  - expand map editor to configure all those different textures and sprites
  - maybe add strafing motion?
  - some kind of objective
  - maybe use the same technique as jumping to give a little walking bounce to player movement
  - pointer controls?
  - cache calculated trig functions; they are somewhat costly and there is a limited number of possible values
